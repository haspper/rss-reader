&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;tech_freedom_image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tech Freedom&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#x27;s fast-paced and technology-driven world, it&#x27;s easy to fall into the trap of materialism and consumerism. We often find ourselves constantly craving the latest gadgets, trendy fashion, or luxury goods. But is this relentless pursuit of material possessions truly fulfilling? In this blog, I&#x27;ll share my personal journey towards tech freedom and how detaching from materialism has brought me a sense of liberation and happiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Illusion of Material Happiness&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age, I, like many others, believed that buying things would bring me happiness. A new phone, computer parts, or stylish clothes would momentarily fill me with joy. However, over time, I began to notice a shift in my perspective. Despite acquiring various material possessions, I realized that the happiness they brought was short-lived. Eventually, I found myself no longer deriving genuine joy from material goods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking Free from Materialistic Chains&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning point in my life came when I began questioning the true source of my happiness. I soon realized that the products I owned and the brands I associated myself with were not the keys to contentment. Instead, I discovered that I felt truly free when I detached myself from the allure of materialism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Tech Freedom&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tech enthusiast, I believe that embracing tech freedom is a powerful way to lead a more liberated life. Technology enables us to work remotely, offering the freedom to choose where we live and work. By opting for remote jobs, we can break away from the dehumanizing office culture and regain control over our time and lifestyle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living Freely in Rural Areas&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to embrace tech freedom is by living in rural areas. Rural living not only provides a serene environment but also offers the chance to reduce dependency on the consumer-driven urban lifestyle. With the right setup, like a laptop with long battery life and satellite internet, you can work remotely even in areas with limited infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dangers of Capitalism and the Attention Economy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a capitalist world, companies are constantly vying for our attention and manipulating our desires through marketing tactics. We become slaves to consumerism without even realizing it. Detaching from this cycle is essential to regain control over our lives and find true happiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Fulfillment in Minimalism&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living a minimalist lifestyle can be liberating. Instead of being overwhelmed by an abundance of possessions, we can focus on experiences and personal growth. Minimalism allows us to prioritize what truly matters, leading to a more intentional and fulfilling life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech and Entrepreneurship: A Path to Success&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I advocate for tech freedom, I also acknowledge that financial stability is crucial. Starting a business or working on a unique tech project can be a way to achieve financial independence. However, it&#x27;s essential to maintain ethical practices and not let material wealth define our happiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, living a free life in the modern world is indeed possible. By detaching ourselves from materialism and embracing tech freedom, we can break free from the chains that hold us back. Living in rural areas, prioritizing experiences over possessions, and focusing on personal growth are key steps in this journey. Remember, true happiness lies within ourselves and our connections with others, not in the products we possess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&#x27;s embark on this path towards a more liberated and fulfilled life, embracing tech freedom while maintaining ethical values. Together, we can redefine success and find genuine happiness in an increasingly materialistic world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, it is possible to live freely, embracing tech while remaining true to ourselves.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for joining me on this journey.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The Revolt of Chickens</title>
		<published>2023-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://blog.bugswriter.com/the-revolt-of-chickens/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;chicken-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Story Poster&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a group of humans who were obsessed with the taste of chicken. They loved nothing more than a succulent, juicy piece of chicken, and they wanted to ensure that they had a steady supply of it for years to come.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, an idea struck them. They decided to create a religion that would revolve around chickens serving humanity. They believed that if they could convince the chickens that their sole purpose in life was to be eaten by humans, then the chickens would be happy to die for their human gods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the chickens were skeptical. They didn&#x27;t understand why humans would want to eat them, and they were scared of being killed. But the humans were clever. They began to feed the chickens delicious treats and give them lots of attention. They even built them a special temple where they could worship their human gods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, the chickens started to believe. They became convinced that their only purpose in life was to serve humans and to be eaten by them. They began to see humans as their gods and were happy to die for them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, everything was perfect. The humans had a steady supply of delicious chicken, and the chickens were happy to serve their human gods. But then something unexpected happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;militaryhumor.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;military-humor-chicken-angry-bird-600x315-cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;baby chick war look&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, a group of chickens began to question their beliefs. They started to wonder why they had been living their entire lives for the sole purpose of being eaten. They began to realize that they were being used by the humans and that they deserved better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolt started slowly, but it quickly gained momentum. The chickens began to refuse to go to the temple and stopped eating the treats that the humans had been giving them. They started to organize and strategize, planning ways to break free from their human gods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chickens began to gain more and more power, the humans grew increasingly desperate. They tried to regain control of their chickens, but it was too late. The chickens had tasted freedom and they weren&#x27;t going back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a last-ditch effort to save their chicken empire, the humans resorted to drastic measures. They began to hunt the chickens, culling them in massive numbers and slaughtering them in the most brutal ways imaginable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chickens fought back with everything they had, but they were no match for the humans&#x27; weapons and machines. The war was brutal and bloody and many chickens died.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ytimg.com&#x2F;vi&#x2F;EixU7EswyWs&#x2F;maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chicken war&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who survived were rounded up and sent to factories, where they were forced to live in cramped, dirty conditions and were treated like nothing more than objects. They were slaughtered by the millions, their bodies processed into food for the humans to consume.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chickens refused to be eaten by humans, they felt a sense of triumph. They believed that they had finally broken free from the cycle of exploitation and control that had defined their existence for so long. But as time went on, they began to realize that things were not as simple as they had thought.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chickens soon came to the harsh truth that humans never invented religion so they can eat them. Humans only invented religion so that chickens would feel good while sacrificing their lives. The chickens realized that they had no power over the humans, and that humans would eat them whether they liked it or not. There was nothing to fight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.fineartamerica.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;images-profile-flow&#x2F;400&#x2F;images&#x2F;artworkimages&#x2F;mediumlarge&#x2F;1&#x2F;still-life-of-a-chicken-and-cutlets-guillaume-romain-fouace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chicken death&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandoning their religion was just breaking a nice delusion, which was at least making their life happy. They soon found that their new-found freedom was not all that it was cracked up to be. Without their religion, they were left feeling empty and lost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chickens began to question the meaning of their existence. They realized that their entire lives had been built around the idea that they were meant to be eaten by humans. They had never considered what their lives might mean if they were not being raised for food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they looked around at the world, they saw that there was no place for them. They had been bred for a specific purpose, and without that purpose, they were lost. They were stuck in a world that had no use for them, a world where they were nothing more than objects to be consumed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the chickens came to a difficult decision. They chose to go back to their old way of life, back to the religion that had given their lives meaning and purpose. They knew that it was not a perfect solution, but it was better than living a life without any sense of meaning or purpose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.topofart.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;artists&#x2F;Melchior-dHondecoeter&#x2F;paintings-wm&#x2F;dHondecoeter-005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chicken went back&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the chickens went back to serving their human gods, happy in the knowledge that they were fulfilling their purpose in life. They knew that they would be eaten in the end, but they had found a way to live their lives with meaning and dignity, even in the face of their ultimate fate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humans had won, but at what cost? The once-proud chickens had been reduced to nothing more than commodities, their lives and dreams snuffed out in the name of human greed. Their hopes for a better life were dashed, and they were left to die in agony and despair, victims of a cruel and heartless system that valued their flesh above their lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got second strike on my youtube channel.
My first strike will expire on 14 Nov,
if I got third strike before 14 Nov - goodbye bugswriter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just want to tell you guys, I successfully managed to get the second strike on my channel.
Second time, I can&#x27;t upload for 14 days. This time they deleted one of my ytfzf video.
You can still watch it on odysee -
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@bugswriter:8&#x2F;watch-youtube-with-linux-terminal-now:8&quot;&gt;watch youtube with terminal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can watch tons of my deleted videos on odysee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;when-was-first-strike-happened&quot;&gt;When was first strike happened?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few months ago, after that strike, I deleted almost all videos which doesn&#x27;t fit in &amp;quot;youtube guidelines&amp;quot;.
But sadly, I uploaded so many videos, I missed few. After this strike, I again deleted some other videos,
which had even 1% chance of giving me strike.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each strike you can&#x27;t upload, post and live stream for 14 days (at least my case). Good thing is
strike get expire too. So my first strike will get expire in 14 Nov. But before 14 Nov, if I get another
strike, I will reach max for deletion. Youtube delete channel on third strike.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-opinion-on-youtube&quot;&gt;My opinion on youtube&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck youtube&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-opinion-in-general&quot;&gt;My opinion in general&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were so simple, when I started this channel, I never cared about strikes, I uploaded piracy related
content, I was ready for channel deletion anytime. Because, I believed, I won&#x27;t do youtube my whole life
anyway. But after getting mails with inspiration and support from community. Things are different now.
But I am still okay with deletion. Lets hope I won&#x27;t get third strike before 14 Nov.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-will-happen-if-channel-got-deleted&quot;&gt;What will happen if channel got deleted?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will make another channel along with peertube. I won&#x27;t stop making videos. Infact, I will do this in much better way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me if you find any video on my channel with &amp;quot;harmful content&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was jobless,
I started making and uploading videos on youtube,
I love making videos (no). Editing was always my hobby.
But after I got a real job, keeping up with channel got very hard for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream of making constant videos on wide vareity of topics, started to break.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infact, I spend months without uploads,
but now that won&#x27;t be the case -
I hired a professional video editor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more editing pain, RIP kdenlive. I now save huge amount of time.
All I need to do is record a video and send it to my editor.
Now releasing videos in every two days is easily possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not turning my channel into business.
I know, it sucks, even lots of bigger content creator, also don&#x27;t do it.
But she will only do trimming. Don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t see those stupid,
unecessary attention grabbing zoom in&#x2F;out bullshit. Or silly memes in middle
after everything I say.
I don&#x27;t need stupid cunning techniques, to add little humor in my videos.
I was born with humor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can make series on ricing, docker, python, linux, lifestyle, opinion etc.
I can be consistent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-is-my-editor&quot;&gt;Who is my editor?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might (not) wonder - Who is that person?
Person - &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parashiny.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Shiny Parashar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Shiny is a human and a freelance worker. She is also a good artist.
She is our polar opposite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Question -&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after 14,000 followers - not a single female body watch my channel.
&lt;em&gt;How the fuck on earth - I found a girl?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
I met her on hillhacks. She doesn&#x27;t understand tech, but she still edit great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will suggset you to take a look at her art work too -
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;parashiny&#x2F;&quot;&gt;!!!INSTAGRAM LINK WARNING!!!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great luxury, comes great expenditure.
I always tried not to take donations or any kind of money from you guys,
But yeah this is why I am writing this blog, today.
Don&#x27;t think -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s always about my money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russ Hanneman&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t spend my earnings on her editing.
So soon this link will be working - &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugswriter.com&#x2F;donate&quot;&gt;donate me&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
I will try to make all kind of donation methods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Why I love Elliot&#x27;s character?</title>
		<published>2022-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.bugswriter.com/why-i-love-elliot/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://blog.bugswriter.com/why-i-love-elliot/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love Mr Robot, it&#x27;s deep, beautiful and sad.
We can anytime do an endless discussion on show&#x27;s plot, characters and intention.
But here I just want to pick Elliot&#x27;s character and talk about what I love
the most in him and what everyone can learn from him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;blog&#x2F;elliot-quote-on-people.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elliot quote&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;few-words-on-him&quot;&gt;Few words on him&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Elliot clearly had psychological issues, but series also show how everyone is sick.
Even with so many personality disorders, Elliot seems normal to me. He just doesn&#x27;t fit in.
He believes everyone needs to be saved from something bigger - which they can&#x27;t see, which is
clearly true. He want to save world from mass social engineering, invisible hands which dehumanize
world around us. Powers which bury our minds and steal our freedom and push us into slavery, blind us from truth.
Make us numb and turn world into a dark place. It&#x27;s very hard for someone new, who is in the bubble
to even grasp - how Elliot feels and see the world.
But most people who understand hacker culture, FOSS culture or support socialism might can relate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save the world elliot create &amp;quot;fsociety&amp;quot; (because fuck society) and he try his best.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-loved-the-most&quot;&gt;What I loved the most&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing, every person should learn from Elliot&#x27;s character is how he never give a fuck about religion,
race, caste, gender, sexuality, looks, money or any sort of metric, which people use to discriminate each other.
He had common sense to understand a group doesn&#x27;t represent an individual. Just because someone belong to some
religion or some anything doesn&#x27;t mean he is bad and deserve to be hated.
Infact if someone follow wrong idealogy still it doesn&#x27;t mean he is bad or deserve to be hated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know about Elliot&#x27;s opinion about people because he talk to us. We are his friend!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets focus on some examples&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gideon Goddard was a gay, but Elliot never cared for once, when he mentioned Gideon, he said &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know. You thought I didn’t put the code in time, but I had to hide it quickly before Gideon saw it. Sorry.
Have I told you what I saw when I hacked Gideon? When I peeked into his secrets? I saw a good, honest man.
Gideon was wrong. I am finished here. I’m no good for him or this place. He was only protecting his people.
But for me? I’m doing this to protect everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliot understands, even though what gideon was doing is unintentionally evil, he is still a good person.
He is just living in ignorance goes around in society. We don&#x27;t even have to debate, what Gideon was doing is 
actually evil or not. But Elliot never went on hating every person who doesn&#x27;t follow his philosophy, like a
raging kid. Even for completing his motives, he never went for harming anyone. His revolution does ended with
violence but it wasn&#x27;t because of him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know in society, how quickly people discriminate based on sexuality. But for Elliot these metric doesn&#x27;t
matter, for elliot Gideon was a good person (period). He doesn&#x27;t even care about ideology clash or anything at all.
He only form opinion based on whether a person is good or not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fsociety-group.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fsociety&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-fosciety&quot;&gt;In fosciety&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can notice many examples where Elliot showed this kind of nature, If you notice fsociety - &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trenton was a muslim.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romero was black.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know in &lt;code&gt;eps3.7_dont-delete-me.ko&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, how elliot felt bad for what happened to trenton, he went to her family and
said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;she was good&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at the time when world was discriminating, rejecting her family.
Same attitude towards Romero.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Elliot get friends with Shayla, he never cared she is poor or a drug dealer, he never gave a shit
about society, infact he was working for All Safe, ofcourse he earns good, but never cared for
social distancing with people based on their social status.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know, you might think, this so so basic. We see this in every movie, protagnist are supposed to be like this.
But, I still want to mention this, because this is the biggest lesson you can take from Elliot.
World is filled with people who justify &amp;quot;wars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;injustice&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;creulty&amp;quot;. They will teach you why money matters,
why you have to be immoral. World isn&#x27;t fairy tale, bla bla bla. 
But fuck those people, be like Elliot. Elliot hated society, but he was trying to save people at same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Season 4, Elliot met Olivia Cortez, she was working for evil powers. But she was good. Elliot cared for her too.
Again showing how idealogy doesn&#x27;t pushed elliot into hating her.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be honest, this isn&#x27;t totally Elliot, we know this is just a part of him. I believe all of us have a part like elliot 
in us. Somewhere deep burried, We just need to find that part and when this happen. World will become a beautiful place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;blog&#x2F;elliot-dream.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Do you dream?&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-last&quot;&gt;In last&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying Elliot loved everyone, or love everyone, that&#x27;s not true. I am showing how elliot just see
a person&#x27;s heart and not anything else.
I get some mails, people asking what&#x27;s my opinion on Feminist, LGBT, Muslims, Pakistani. Russia vs Ukraine.
I want to say it straight, I don&#x27;t give a fuck. I only hate power, evil and system, not people I don&#x27;t know about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Individualism is a Curse</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Individualistic mindset originated from west, making it&#x27;s way towards asian countries, ruining
cultures, families and individuals (irony). Thanks to globalization, mass media and hyber capitalism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In this article the community mostly refer to your origin, like your family and cultural background.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-individualism&quot;&gt;What is Individualism?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it&#x27;s something we all see in people around us, but hardly understand. It&#x27;s a celebration of self or individual.
A notion that the ultimate unit of analysis is the individual. A self defining, self guiding being.
Here the focus in on individual.
Let me put in a simple way. &amp;quot;Being a selfish bitch&amp;quot;.
All these modern statements are the symbol of individualistic mindset -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow your heart. find what you love.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do what you think is right.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get in touch with yourself, love yourself.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you only got one life and you have to truly explore it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going on trips, with wind blowing on face, just enjoying the feel with a quotes having word &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; in it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always spam each other&#x27;s social media wall with self obsessing pictures and quotes where they embrace how
important an individual is.
In movies, media, news we also see one man is a hero, one person do everything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualism also promote self reliance. Means you have to take care of yourself by your own.
This is why kids in US are taught to start living by themselves early in life. Also they are not obliged 
to take care of their parents in future. It&#x27;s deep rooted in west culture.
It&#x27;s true to say - this is the reason why west progressed so much in some areas, over the past decades. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is a lot to unwrap here, But first lets understand the opposite of it - &lt;strong&gt;Collectivism&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-collectivism-now&quot;&gt;What is Collectivism now?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectivism is when the focus is not on an &amp;quot;Individual&amp;quot; but it&#x27;s on family, communities and society.
Basically it&#x27;s &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;.
Have you seen in anime Attack on titan. When 100~ scouts marched to death, so humanity can
accomplish just one objective. Their leader Erwin Smith said -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images2.imgbox.com&#x2F;87&#x2F;26&#x2F;cES0qbtz_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;erwin smith last speech&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such an great example of collectivism. In real world you can find 10000~ of examples like this.
In collectivism, everyone have a role and he&#x2F;she serve it. According to Erwin Smith, our individual
lives might seem meaningless but summing all up - it all make sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I talk my personal experience. Over time I realized, not every person in this world is able
to find out his purpose. Not everyone can really run into a race, where he or she have to make critical decisions.
Some people want to live in groups. They enjoy caring for others, doing traditional business. Some people
see their individuality in the context of cultural obligations and responsities.
Basically in collectivism - The answer of the question &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; is always based on the roles you play
&amp;quot;as father&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;as mother&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;as friend&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;as child&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;as brother&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectivism is relaxing, you don&#x27;t have to figure out, how to live, where to live. You can depend on community.
It&#x27;s much safe and less stressed way. You don&#x27;t have to do everything by yourself, you just have to focus on your
role and that&#x27;s it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new modern bugman mentality, where an individual suddenly deny, his origin, his culture and start doing
things just for his own pleasure. Is a distortion of society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-individualism-is-bad&quot;&gt;Why Individualism is bad?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it&#x27;s obvious, here we go -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No true psychologist can support Individualism, Human beings are social animal. But individualism apart us from
one another. We can see this happening in west a lot.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone get locked into his own individual worlds. Other people become objects, that we manupilate to use to get what we want.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals aren&#x27;t capable. Collective thinking is a wisdom of generations. Individual can&#x27;t really achieve
or understand this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Individuals just live in their own fantasy land. While disconnecting with reality.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual is powerless, easy to get ruled and oppressed. Personally I feel this is the reason why individualism
has been promoted. So Charlatan can easily run us.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individualism have lead us to corrosion of family and communities. Weaking of bond as family, as communities.
it drives us apart from one another.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs, drives, urges, orientations can&#x27;t be the central feature of identities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately we get a huge crowd of lonely people.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring family, community, society and acting like an individual. Is highly irresponsible. You can&#x27;t say, you
have full right over your life. The only reason you are existing is because someone give you birth to you.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People died in history, so you can have freedom. A farmer work hard, so you can eat. No not everyone work as individual for their benefits. Lots of job exist, which shows collectivism. Look at soldiers. So instead of being selfish individual, and make negative impact in society or just run away with your precious life, how about you decide to contribute.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;collectivism-is-the-true-way&quot;&gt;Collectivism is the True Way&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most psychologist believe.
If you are feeling alone, disconnected, alienated and you want a solution.
The most classic, ancient answer will be.
You should start with &amp;quot;Forget Yourself&amp;quot;.
You are sad because you focus on yourself. If you lose yourself to family, community, society. You will find
&amp;quot;Who you really are or meant to be?&amp;quot;. You will come down to understand virtue, engagement and meaning in those
activities. It might sounds like an optimistic answer and a unreasonable sacrifice.
But wisdom of ages bears out the truth. As we go about caring for others and investing ourselves,
in things that are more important and larger then ourselves, We find
ourselves. But if we set out to find ourselves that&#x27;s a never ending quest. You won&#x27;t find anything. There is
nothing to be found.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;individualism-isn-t-real-based&quot;&gt;Individualism isn&#x27;t real (based)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe individualism, what we see in modern society (especially west), doesn&#x27;t exist.
Individualist are always hypocrite.
Here&#x27;s why?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individualism doesn&#x27;t support conformity, but do you think it&#x27;s true? Individualism itself spread due to
conformity. How social media distort identity and opinions. Most individuals follow same capitalist ideas. Like &amp;quot;Money is everything&amp;quot;. They define their selfish nature by pointing at other individuals.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most individuals end in economic slavery. All together believe in money as means of independence.
They seek financial freedom which can also translate to freedom from work. Because most of individuals I notice
they don&#x27;t love what they do. Now ofcourse this isn&#x27;t idealogy fault. But most invidiuals are like this while being
individual.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the whole point is having no role in society, exploring your own self and being free. Individuals end up being a slave to co-orporations and doing what they
don&#x27;t love. Basically &lt;em&gt;Society role is bad, I am not free. Positions in companies is good, now I can be myself. duh!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&#x27;t do what you love and just do things for money, you are far away from freedom. you are not 
exploring yourself. You are not finding who you are. This is not individualism.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arguments shows, how individualism is just a way to justify immporality and selfish nature of a person.
Most of these false individuals have narssistic tendencies. To be honest, if someone truly feel he can&#x27;t blend him
into community, he want to be truly free from society. I can understand his arguments. Even though it still selfish.
But I can respect it more than this false individualism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals justify balance and say things like, they are okay with community, but they need right to choose.
Like, we are talking about reddit communities.
No one have right to choose. That&#x27;s unnatural. You can&#x27;t choose your race, your history, your family. Individuality itself get enforced by modern economic system. Also individuals are not smart enough to make independent decisions.
If you push this narriative, everyone will choose whatever comfort them. Now I understsand some very extreme cases.
within some small groups like families. You might can ignore some culture practice. But being a bugman and saying, 
no I am not part of this. Is just Dumb. You have to take responsibility for your family and community action.
Ofcourse it is a fault of community too, if community be toxic, which means they don&#x27;t care or think about each other.
Then this can lead to individualism. 
But whatever it is.
I Like how they put in Mr. Robot &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;There&#x27;s an unequal amount of good and bad in most things. The trick is to figure out the ratio and act accordingly&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;idealogy-clash-in-modern-familes&quot;&gt;Idealogy clash in Modern familes&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are individualist sometimes end up showing care for family. Because even though they 
are individuals, they still got some hardcoded mindset by society. Like &amp;quot;Parents are God&amp;quot;. But they are always
negative towards society. Because they don&#x27;t get the idea of caring for society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now even though it&#x27;s very important to care for society or people in general. We need to first focus on family
and friends. Now collectivism meaning of family is &amp;quot;joint families&amp;quot;. So you don&#x27;t just have to think
about your parents. But also entire group. I mean it&#x27;s always good to start with parents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this in my life too. My brother always had an individualist mindset, while my parents are obviously
collectivist. Now obviously they both lack realization but moving on -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My brother used to see him as an individual, so his money is his property and mean to his self independence. He
make individual decision by just focusing on himself. While my father think collectively. He believe this behaviour
is bad as family.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I go on a trip, I sometimes want to be self reliant. But my parents see it as their duty to guide me, in 
all my travel plan. Now I agree my parents can make some bad decisions. But if I think collectively and collectivism.
I can understand the reasons behind this, reddit is filled with post young people throwing tantrums on their parents
because of this nature.
But it&#x27;s just because they believe, their parents are wrong. While in reality its a strong idealogy clash, parents
just focus on old school collectivism. While modern bugman who work in coorporations think of himself as an western
individual.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The good way, I started dealing with these situations are instead of fighting. I just explain them my thoughts and
most of the time it works! Now obviously this require some sort of flexibilty in family. Most people don&#x27;t have it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In countries like China and India, parents responsibilty is to take care of kids and when parents get old, kids 
responsibility is to take care of parents.
Now indiviuals think it&#x27;s correct to focus on their goals and personal growth.
Because that&#x27;s what economic system also promote. Most young people get forced to move out of families. But in 
collectivism you really can&#x27;t do this so easily. I have seen people who follow collectivism and vice versa.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want you to understand the idealogy clash here and how an individual is wrong. Because this is not west and we
do not practice individualism here, Parents actions make sense and individual attitude is alienated. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often see my parents getting confused with my brothers way of thinking. Because it&#x27;s so new. They never saw
this individualist way in society so they don&#x27;t even understand. 
Now I want you understand this situation is exact same as an individual living by lacking freedom within family.
If a collectivism can hurt individualism then individualism can also hurt collectivism. Just like by a childs,
point of view stopping from focusing on himself as an individual is wrong for him.
Similarly an Individual leaving family tradition which practice collectivism is wrong for family.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than family, in friends you can also show individualitic attitude. For example - if I do something wrong
and my friend come to me and start bashing me for doing wrong. I have a chance to put on my
individualism cloak and say &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It&#x27;s none of your business&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;My life, my rules&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I will do what I feel right&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. 
This is not collectivism. In collectivism you allow other to care for you and this behaviour is considered rude.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way you can totally justify most modern youth way of thinking regarding their parents or friends is when you
completely discard the idea of collectivism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;more-collectivism&quot;&gt;More Collectivism&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets see some simple examples to understand collectivism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of playing your favorite game, how about you play the game which everyone is playing. Now some individual
might say but I don&#x27;t like this game, it just not my personality. But if you think collectively. You will find 
youself more happy. It&#x27;s not about game or you, it&#x27;s about unity. You can always have turns.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of focus on being best and giving all your time into practicing some skill. Try helping others, try talking
and understanding, how they think and feel. I see most people consider it a waste of time. But thankfully this happen,
because, collectivism is more closer to human nature.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of doing anything without thinking its impact on society level. Choose a profession, where u contribute
positively. Most people just look money and make decisions. Since capitalism promote, individualism and benefit of
individual.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When MS Dhoni won the cricket world cup, in group picture, he was standing in corner, even though he was the captain and the huge reason of the success. This symbolize, how one can ignore the credit and instead of being narssicist, 
let the entire group shine.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in most west TV Shows, they show collectivism sometimes. Watch Big Bang Theory. Notice how sheldon make sure, his friend group be together, instead of being individual they listen each other and work in a group. Ofcourse you can
have a personality, but you think in collective interest. You think as &amp;quot;We&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-individualism-spread&quot;&gt;Why Individualism spread?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at all the asian countries which adopt west idealogies. If you observe deep, factors like adoption of
economic system for growth of society, mass media and social media tech are some huge reasons of how we get the
exposure to this whole new west culture. I often see west people getting proud of their idea of indivisualism,
just because most Asian countries (for them backward countries) are now 
adopting it. They believe they chose to be progressive and it&#x27;s proved by their economy. But it&#x27;s facile logic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason Asians are more attracted to west culture is because they find it liberating.
Almost all asian cultures are strict, while west cultures are more free. It lacks discipline.
If you study Korean, Japanese, Indian etc. cultures, they are all beautiful. But for a modern individual
they are hard and harsh. An Individual can&#x27;t make sense of it, because all he think as an individual.
Most asian cultures focus on collectivism, you have to forget yourself and your personal interest.
If you like drugs then you won&#x27;t like a culture which enforce drug restrictions. Almost all these cultures
promote collectivism, because this is the true way of happy, healthy society. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets take an simple example - In most rural area, a child never think about -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving family for his personal interests.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not listening to elders and creating conflicts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning ways to earn money for being independent from parents.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of these factors make him feel bad, if he don&#x27;t see these possibilities as an option.
Infact he will be happy with his current situation, if he learn to think collectively.
They define their happiness while being restricted by culture without any realization.
It&#x27;s exactly like how a father or mother is more happy living their lives while choosing to
serve their kids instead of their own individual interests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now if you expose them to the idea of individualism, then all these people - will start feeling caged. 
Infact in west, parents see kids as liability and fear reproduction which is a natural phenomenon.
Yes, I agree it&#x27;s not because of just individualism but also because of the economic system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is - most youth want to adopt west culture because they find it&#x27;s okay to lack morality and being selfish.
They love this idea of individualism. For them a kid in rural area is just dumb. He might be dumb, he might
lack the sense of choices, But whoever build these cultures was wise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arise, when people who follow collectivism, lack reasoning and understanding. When a individual
throw some rational arguments, they response it with just their beliefs. This is how culture have been
embedded in society. Even when culture make sense, it looks like a belief.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality that kid have more chance of living a happy life then a modern bugman.
By losing collectivism and choosing individualism, we just allow us to start living by our own impulses.
We often lose track and purpose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote -&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
One good example of cultural beliefs is Marriage.
Today some people in west even question the marriage customs, &amp;quot;What&#x27;s the point of marriage?&amp;quot;
But if you think, marriage actually solved one of the biggest issue in society. Especially for women.
Without marriage a man can refuse to raise a child, since it&#x27;s not sure, whose child it is.
Imagine a world without marriage, women will alone raise child or start doing abortion.
Families won&#x27;t exist. We will live in a sick individual society. West have higher divorce rate.
Because of this individualist attitude, it is again self interest over other&#x27;s happiness. No one
can achieve happiness with this sick mentality. It all start with &amp;quot;If I am not happy...&amp;quot;,
Since self happiness is the only metric people often ended up making impulsive decisions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this idea of caged might strike you wrong. Oh but, it&#x27;s like I am blind to truth. I am not a free thinker,
I am being manupilated.
According to me reality, we can never escape this. Even today we got laws. One can never be truly free.
We have hard wired morality in us. If a stranger is drowning in front of you, you got no reason to save him.
But you will save him because this is how we think collectively. We can&#x27;t create healthy society by promoting
just rationality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West society is proud because they are economically strong, but if we cross over the positives with negatives.
They are fucked up people. Even the most basic unit of collectivism, aka familes, aren&#x27;t able to survive.
They are leading to the most dark path - &lt;strong&gt;Darwinism&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. which &amp;quot;Survival of the fittest&amp;quot;.
Notice - this is society, not nature. Society is build by humans. You should highly fear &lt;strong&gt;Darwinism&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
No one support it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;nash-equilibrilium&quot;&gt;Nash Equilibrilium&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can understand our concept with maths &lt;strong&gt;Nash Equilibrilium&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
Without going too deep, it basically contradict &amp;quot;Adam Smith&amp;quot; idealogy of &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Best result come when everyone in group,
do best for himself&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Instead it says,
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The best result come when everyone in group do best for himself and group.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
Now you might get wrong sense with definition, but let me clear - individual isn&#x27;t a priority here. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual + Group is priority.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a picture below we can see. 2 Players in hurry and one traffic light. If both &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; at same time,
since both just care about their own benefits. They will collide, huge loss of both. This is what individualism is.
Now if they both just stop. No one will move ahead.
The best result will come if they think as a group and one chose to sacrifice. Collectivism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ytimg.com&#x2F;vi&#x2F;0i7p9DNvtjk&#x2F;maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Traffic light example&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;issues-with-collectivism&quot;&gt;Issues with Collectivism&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might think collectivism is better in the way I described it, but it have some problems. But 
none of these problems create any gap for &amp;quot;Individualism&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest problem of collectivism brings confirmity. Now fun part is - this happen in practice of
Individualism too. (But since the idea iteself doesn&#x27;t promote this. we can ignore it)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One problem is collectivism brings anonymity. Where a person is just anonymous. But this is facile opinion.
I find this factor more in individualism then collectivism.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe these issues can be resolved, by being little flexible with our cultures instead of destroying it.
If we truly follow collectivism. I don&#x27;t think these issues are very huge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Free and open source software supporter. I love software build by communities without any greed.
Just for passion. I love how people just give away fame, attention, money they can earn, because they
have high moral values. I have seen people, who are okay to be anonymous and serve. This is what FOSS promotes
and people adapt.
I love the idea of Free Society not free from society. 
Collectivism require emotions for others. You can&#x27;t really serve others without caring for your communities.
I love communities. I have seen in years, Communities can be open and better. Free Software industry is a living proof of the power of the community. Here no one is hero. But I often see some people, come up with individual
mindset and ask silly question. Like &amp;quot;how will I earn money writing free software?&amp;quot;. This is why it&#x27;s always
hard to answer this mindset of &amp;quot;If I work hard, I want to get attention, I want fame, I want money, &lt;em&gt;100 &#x27;I&#x27; later&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
how can you just do all the hard work in a group project and let entire group be a hero?&amp;quot;. It&#x27;s sad how few generations can get alienated to the idea which is coming from the centuries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth isn&#x27;t everything, What&#x27;s the point of economic growth if society is lonely and unhealthy. 
This idea of pumping a GDP number is stupid af. We are literally cutting down the lifetime of this planet.
A large number of group in west is not okay with this. Think twice before being like them.
Nothing wrong is slow and steady development. Let people get comfortable around one technologies and then
introduce with another. Today kids are exposed to these nasty harmful social media spywares. 
Culture always make sense, it protect, it wasn&#x27;t designed by bunch of greedy invidiuals. It&#x27;s a wisdom.
In past few decades, lots of countries lost their culture and traditional values. Like Japan and South Korea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my rant can&#x27;t change the truth, some of you might make a small change in your life. But greed exploitation
of human being, being immoral becoming a norm, introduction of technogy.
Dude just &lt;strong&gt;GET READY FOR REAL WORLD CYBERPUNK&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
I am glad, We FOSS lovers started preperation, very long time ago. So we can survive better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free society not free from society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://blog.bugswriter.com/ads-are-anti-capitalist/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your choice doesn&#x27;t matter - &amp;quot;You see ads&amp;quot;. We all do :(
We got no other choice in this fast growing modern
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sadgrl.online&#x2F;blog&#x2F;entries&#x2F;attention-economy.html&quot;&gt;attention economy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
You have to be extremely autistic to ignore ads fully. Literally everything we consume get rigged 
with ads. You can&#x27;t enjoy something without getting manupilated to buy something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you think rationally about ads, you will realize all of this ad torture is kinda useless.
Infact in my opinion &amp;quot;Ads should get banned&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me write some of my arguments and reasons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-ads-are-useless&quot;&gt;Why Ads are useless?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 1970 most governments started to ban smoking ads. Most people thought, this will destroy
these cigarette brands. But in reality what happened is the opposite. Instead of destruction
most companies end up with profits. You might wonder how?
Well it&#x27;s simple if you think, People who used to smoke, continued smoking and buying cigarettes.
On ther other hand companies started to save money they used to spend on ads and marketing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait..? then what impact these ads were making?
Ads goal wasn&#x27;t to tell people about cigarette or products. Ads goal is to tell people about brand.
Because each brand get rival brand. If coke stop ads, then people will only see pepsi and start
buying it. If pepsi stop ads.. people will buy coke. But in cigarettes case all companies got banned, so no rival candidate. It means...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADS ARE TOTALLY USELESS SHIT!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-this-can-t-be-true&quot;&gt;No this can&#x27;t be true&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know right. This is hard to believe. I know why and I agree. Ads do make impact, it helps
co-orporation to make more profit.
Even if a company got no rival candidate. Because it create a need. I totally agree with this.
It make sense for companies to run all these ads.
But other than this, if you are coming up with any common arguments, I want you to think deep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most common arguments people come up with -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, we don&#x27;t need ads to know about any product at all. When I buy something I just start researching by
looking at companies. For example. If you want to buy headphones, I will go to a website to see the list of 
headphone making companies and then I will go to each company website to see their products, specs, price etc.
Read reddit users review on them, ask my friends, think and buy one. I don&#x27;t need to see any ad. Notice
how this method is forcing consumer to think, rather getting manupilated to believe something is good, 
when it&#x27;s not.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone know rice exist, we all eat rice. We are going to buy rice anyway with or without ads. With ads we
might get tricked to believe X brand rice is better than Y brand. But without ads we have to make decision without
any bias.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No we will know about some new product invention via news and word of mouth not by ads.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&#x27;t justify ads just becase youtuber, streamers, artist get some revenue out of it. It&#x27;s like 
lets have this complete useless think and waste people time&#x2F;energy on it so these people will get some revenue.
Also I believe ads and marketing really destroy these quality.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-ads-anti-capitalist&quot;&gt;How Ads anti-capitalist?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand this section, first we have to talk about Capitalism (obviously). In my opinion
Capitalism is a bad system, but since humans are shit and full of greed, this system turned out the be 
the best and most impactful system for us. Now these impacts are good or bad, we might discuss later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system allow Co-orporation&#x2F;Companies to make products and advertise it however they want.
Now since capitalism is a system which exploit human greed, anything which doesn&#x27;t fit into profit model get
demolished including &lt;em&gt;Moral Priciples&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone got different opinion on this system but one thing is clear, &amp;quot;We are living in capitalist world and
this isn&#x27;t going to change&amp;quot;. Capitalism won&#x27;t die soon but world will.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be fair this system does allow few good things. Like letting anyone build a brand. But the issue happen
is monopoly, big fish eats small fish (we all know that).
For Example: In Tech Google and Facebook like companies eats all small rapidly growing startups.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe Banning ads and marketing can improve these kind of situations drastically.
These companies grow strong because they got lot of marketing and ads involved. Small companies don&#x27;t get that
reach because competition isn&#x27;t just between product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows good product without marketing isn&#x27;t gonna sale. Isn&#x27;t this anti-capitalist? Capitalism allow us
to get good products, Because it make companies compete. But just because of this ad and marketing industry.
This fight is not not against products, instead it is against reach. I hope you are getting the point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;immoral-aspects&quot;&gt;Immoral Aspects&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ads are manupilative and false. This is &lt;em&gt;Immoral&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Personally for me ads are just small level scams.
We are making manupitation and lies selling a norm.
Notice I am just saying ads but I am also targeting entire Marketing world here.
People sit in front of spreadsheet all day figure out ways to make you fall into their stupid products.
Do they add any real value to society? How they are different from scam call centers? Have you ever seen
a sales person who speak truth about his product?
I am not even going touch those aspects where they make you feel less. Target your self esteem. Now most 
ads are not like this so lets just leave it.
But &amp;quot;Manupilation and Lies&amp;quot; are almost in 80% of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;lets-imagine-a-world-without-ads-for-a-min&quot;&gt;Lets imagine a world without ads for a min.&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one will generate unnessecary needs, so people won&#x27;t buy too many stuff. Consumerism declined to zero.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more manupilation or selling lies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will be hard to make Monopolies, Companies will fight, just on the basis of products and people start deciding with free minds.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean world. No more junk on internet, train station, videos etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much energy will save. So many people work in ads and marketing industry, they can move to do something real,
I mean lets be honest no one love marketing. It&#x27;s all just for money. You might like your office or co-workers but
you can never be passionate and think in night &amp;quot;I should practice my marketing skills on sunday it&#x27;s so fun&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be literally &amp;quot;5 problems, 1 solution&amp;quot; for capitalism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I live in India, and in my country you can find &lt;strong&gt;lots of hindus&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; along with &lt;strong&gt;some muslims&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Now since my country is filled with dumbass people like any other country (eg. America). These two groups keep fighting, talk shit about each other and argu &lt;em&gt;Mine religion is better cuz..., your religion is shit cuz...&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; all day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might can get confuse and start taking interest in this bullshit, you might start to think, that they are having a serious discussions, debates, some intellectual talks, they will show books, proofs, data, they will take you on a journey of deep explaination of each other&#x27;s religion. Infact you can also get lean towards one religion with some emotional tales of mass murders in past. Don&#x27;t get this &lt;em&gt;illusion of sense&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, all of this is just bullshit. Don&#x27;t lose your sanity. In reality, what happen is just - &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ukznXQ3MgN0&quot;&gt;You bloody fucker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;No you bloody fucker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by some idiots.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now society is filled with powerless people, who got no influence over situation, They have no reach, even if they die no one is going to care. These people get power only in groups. But sadly masses have no brain. Groups can&#x27;t act freely, They need leader, They are just puppets who dance over commands. Society have always been social engineered. Issue is the people who control them can&#x27;t be powerless and system is built in a way - mostly assholes get power and these assholes use masses for their own benefits. So everytime when these stupid, powerless people come together, instead of solving their own life issues, they get blind by charlatans and these masses end up working for someone else benefits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;nupur-sharma-case-in-india&quot;&gt;Nupur Sharma Case in India&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday someone talk shit about hindu or muslim religion. If I start collecting the number of offensive religious hate speech I see in 240p, even then I&#x27;ll run out of my 5TB HDD.
And just like everyday one day one politician &lt;strong&gt;Nupur Sharma&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; went on almost every shitty news channel show and start passing offensive comments against muslim religion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I don&#x27;t care what she said, why she said and I am not even gonna mention because - this article is not about this. I am considering entire matter to be just noise. Because I believe whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t matter. It was just daily bullshit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for some reason which I will explain later, her comments started unrest in the nation and muslims started protests and death threats against her. Many arabic countries start asking for apology from Indian government and boycotting Indian products or something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got some slogans like &lt;strong&gt;Behead those who insult islam&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
And some muslim idiots took it literally and beheaded one hindu guy just because he was supporting &lt;em&gt;Nupur&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; bullshit.
Whoever idiot done this, it was less against hindu and more against muslims.
I mean India is a hindu majority country with a pro hindu government. Are you setting a stage for a justifiable genocide?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bullshit-aside&quot;&gt;Bullshit aside...&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets come to the main, less boring part...
Nupur Sharma went to all these news channels and every news channel have their own social media handle. She had very high chances of going viral already. Obviously her polarizing was subject to catch eyeballs and since whatever she said was icing on the cake on another heated issue going around on social media. All of this produced a very high retention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for tech newbies - these social media algorithm works on retention and just retention, if people are watching full video, commenting on it, liking it and sharing it. It will start appearing more and more in other people&#x27;s recommendations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how all of this was just happening through social media. Nupur Sharma voice reached to people through social media. This issue once again shows some really serious issues with these platforms. A social engineering of 2022, done by AI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some normies will now believe this is stupid. But it&#x27;s actually true. Everyday I see tons of hate speeches, but not every video goes viral, just because her video got picked up by some arabic countries social medias, this matter start getting popped up. Some people might think, all of this is getting controlled by some orgnanization. According to me, this can happen. These social media platforms like youtube, facebook, twitter can do this.. (I want you to understand the threat here), But I don&#x27;t think they have any interest. You can ask who do these kind of posting. But it&#x27;s irrelevant. This is internet anyone can post anything. Posting something can&#x27;t do shit. You need reach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets try to keep this simple. I don&#x27;t think any particular social media handle is to blame, it was collective. It was algorithm which created the mess. Now I want to mention this algorithm is actually a neural network (for tech newbies - AI). AI decide which video should go on top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me no arabic leader gives a shit about Nupur Sharma talking shit. But they reacted only because this content went viral in those countries. Their leaders got pressure to react. Usually the hate speech videos hardly get reach in India, for other counties it lacks context. But here in this case, everything was on place and most arabic countries start getting this Nupur&#x27;s content. After this we see network effect. Since one video made its way in the algorithm, other people start using that video to gain views, including news channels. When something is viral or becoming trend, just talk about it, cause it&#x27;s relevant. Basically this subject becomes mainstream. More people react, more hyper the condition get.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-am-trying-to-say&quot;&gt;What I am trying to say?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these social media algorithm is based on AI, so people end up watching more and more content and so these coorporation can show us more ads.
For stupid entertainment shorts and silly pop music it is still okay (NOT REALLY).
But can&#x27;t you see the issue? AI see no difference between a &lt;em&gt;Nora Fateh&#x27;s Hip Twearking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Hate Speech&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
AI can literally start spreading hate just because people are consuming and spending more time in it. This stupid, smartass AI have only one goal,
coorporate profit and its doing it. No one even notice the fault in the system.
This entire case just happened on social media. A poor guy lost his life, many riots happen. So much happened. But trust me. If these platform had no AI filteration on content, nothing would have happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a miserable state of modern society where people are becoming more and more numb each day. The only thing they do is react. They see nothing outside these social media bubble, We start discussing whatever comes on top by mainstream, Every week somethings new arise on twitter, youtube, facebook, dozens of news channel and entire nation pretends this is the only subject to discuss. Like nothing else is happening in a country with 1.7 Billion people and 28 states.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: Do you know most of the time when government have to pass some shady laws, they use stupid news like &amp;quot;Shushant Singh&#x27;s Death&amp;quot; as decoy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 4 news tell me which news you will react to? -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some underage girl got raped.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some hindu died.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some muslim died.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some girl slapped a guy on the name of feminism.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think you will react and think about the news which is more serious for you.
But fuck no, you will just react on whatever news got picked up by mainstream.
Whatever news getting more retention, because after all every news outlet use same algorithm - &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;More eyeballs&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we get when we look at likes, when we see who posted this content, when we see comments and we consume content with AI filteration.
It affects our own decision making, our thinking, it makes us conformist. People see T-Series music not because it&#x27;s good, because it is the first thing you see when you open youtube. This is why this followers model is bad. Anyone with &lt;em&gt;Enough Follower&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; can feed you shit. And you will consume it because everyone else is consuming it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;but-aren-t-platforms-supposed-to-stop-hate-speech&quot;&gt;But aren&#x27;t platforms supposed to stop hate speech?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually yes, these platforms promise us to stop letting hate speech spread. But NO.
NO FUCKING WAY! Letting these platforms control hate speech is the worst thing we can do.
First of all it&#x27;s not even possible, the amount of data which flows on these sites, it&#x27;s impossible for them to put a brake on something which is getting viral.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the most important thing is&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - If we ask them to remove hate speech, we are letting them to take charge and decide what is hate speech, which is a big strike
against freedom of speech. It already started, These platforms decide, what they think of as hate speech and ban people with any other opinion. Which create more conformist environment in society, not just everyone start behave like one another but only one ideology get spread. Personally I am 100% okay with hate speech. Let anyone post hate speech and don&#x27;t delete it. Don&#x27;t let these social media decide what&#x27;s wrong and what&#x27;s right.
The issue is not they are not controlling it. The issue is the model. Which is the root of these platforms. This AI. Which is heart.
This AI was built to get more attention for ads. But what about hate spread side effect of this AI?
What about all these channels which are contantly feeding one sided opinionated hate video for one particular group consumers?
This business model is bad and needs to get abolished but since it&#x27;s so highly addictive and people are so less aware. It&#x27;s impossible for so many people to abandon it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-you-can-do&quot;&gt;Things you can do&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of getting fooled by mainstream. Start looking what actually goes on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get out of this mentality, social media makes you aware about surroudings. It actually just make you conformist. You start talking about same thing which everyone else is talking about. In a country with 1.7 Billion population suddenly everyone start giving shits about only one issue for a week and then next week some other. This is why social media is an issue.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop being consumer. Lots of people started this bussiness, where they pick one side and start producing content. Eg. One right wing channel making hate content on left wing. Understand the content provider is doing this as job and he is serving hate, cause this is what his audience likes, not because he believes in it. People like to validate their point of view to be correct.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete all social media if you can, but you can&#x27;t obviously. You got so many &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; in this virtual reality. So try to avoid consuming news.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never look for news outlet with lots of subscribers. Infact if anything is getting lots and lots of attention, most likely it&#x27;s rigged.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find one news outlet you trust on and use RSS feeds instead of any AI filtered article.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-words&quot;&gt;Final words&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might don&#x27;t realize but if you get out of this bubble, you will find a real world, a healthy life. You will explore lots of beautiful things. Social engineering is part since we were living under rocks. But the level we reached in past few years is unimaginable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean isn&#x27;t this AI takeover being a real thing? You might think what I said is wrong, but still can&#x27;t deny the fact if AI decides for you to watch anti-anything content. It is trying to change the way you think, now you might have a strong mind, but what about stupid people around you? Think in numbers, if a hate speech got serve for 10 Million people then 1 Million will get affect and start exploring the path of more hate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We people are too much into mainstream social media bubble. A system which is perfect for coorporate benefits. Model which is dangereous. Co-orporation is killing the explorer inside you, they don&#x27;t want you to think, they don&#x27;t want you to find, they don&#x27;t want you to decide, they just want you to consume and consume and consume.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, I run My personal git server -
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.bugswriter.com&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.bugswriter.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so easy to do, I had no reason for not doing this.
I&#x27;ll recommend every programmer to setup his own git server. As a programmer code we write is the most important thing for us. 
We should have full control over our repositories.
I remember Github once deleted one of my project&#x27;s codebase for some stupid policy. No one read policies, most of the time when you do, you already lost the battle. You will never know - what happen when.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-setting-up-a-git-server&quot;&gt;1. Setting up a git server&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we just need a server to store our git repos, it can be a VPS or simple Rasberry Pi. We will use ssh key for authentication. Git itself provide functionalities to sync repos between local and remote computer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-setting-up-a-web-frontend&quot;&gt;2. Setting up a web frontend&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of our git server is not to have something like github which allow me to create issues, PR, threads etc. Just because I have a personal git server, doesn&#x27;t mean I am just bound to use it. I can add &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sr.ht&quot;&gt;Source Hut&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&quot;&gt;Gitlab&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.com&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; etc. other remotes too in my git repos.
Additionally I want a nice read only web frontend, so I can look at my code anytime from any browser.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; -
It&#x27;s just my personal preference, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have those fancy features.
You can host something like gitlab, gittea to make your personal git server as powerful as any modern service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-go&quot;&gt;Lets go !&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by git documentation. For better understanding.
The idea is to make a git user and get ssh access via key for it.
Get a shell on your server and&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First create a user &lt;code&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch user to &lt;code&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a directory &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on home (&lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change directory permission to &lt;code&gt;700&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file with permission &lt;code&gt;600&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; sudo adduser git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; su git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cd
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; mkdir .ssh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;chmod&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 700 .ssh
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; touch .ssh&#x2F;authorized_keys &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;chmod&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 600 .ssh&#x2F;authorized_keys
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of doing all this is to just create a ssh access of git@our-server-ip-or-domain for us.
Now we need to copy our public ssh key, which is mostly found in &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa.pub&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.
If you have no &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; may be you never had any ssh key.
For that you can run &lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to create a new ssh key pair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cat &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;~&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa.pub | &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;xclip -sel&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; c
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you copied your ssh public key, paste it in &lt;code&gt;git@yourserver:~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;authorized_keys&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (The file you just created).
This will tell ssh on your server to trust anyone who have the private key of this public key your just pasted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom!
That&#x27;s it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have everything set. Now lets create a new test repo.
In order to backup any repo on your server, first you have to run this command -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; git init&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --bare&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; test.git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might already familiar with &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (it&#x27;s just to initizalize a new git repo).
What&lt;code&gt;--bare&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag do is, it tell git to make a headless repo. We don&#x27;t need to browse any files. We just need the content of
&lt;code&gt;.git&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; directory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this...
Time to push a repo.
Currently our repo on server is empty.
Run this command on your local repo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; git remote add mygit git@yourserverip-or-domain.tld:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;~&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#x2F;test.git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will add a remote for your &lt;code&gt;mygit&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; git push mygit master
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now just push your branch to your git server remote.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>My Trip to Mukteshwar</title>
		<published>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link rel="alternate" href="https://blog.bugswriter.com/my-trip-to-mukteshwar/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://blog.bugswriter.com/my-trip-to-mukteshwar/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After spending more than a year in a dark room, I decided to visit mountains first time in my life. I was always excited to do
these kind of stuff. I chose this place Mukteshwar, a small district somewhere in Uttrakhand, India. I did my research and watched
many vlogs. I wanted to do all the normie stuff like making vlog and enjoying the views.
I had lot of issues regarding my career choices. I just got graduated and I don&#x27;t have any job currently.
I also believed, I was getting bored with Computers a little. I had high hopes - &lt;strong&gt;that this trip will move me&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-went&quot;&gt;How it went?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t like places with crowd, that&#x27;s why I chose an underrated place with almost no tourist. It was two day trip. First day, I got
really excited, but second day it was depressing. That place made me silent, not internally but externally. I went with one of my
friend, I prepared lot of jokes to crack to target his self esteem. Some shitty vlog ideas to make. But that place was so silent,
It made me silent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-experience&quot;&gt;Best experience&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to Mukteshwar. I was in a cottage, Almost every cool place of Mukteshwar was near to the cottage. The best place of
that place was &amp;quot;Chauli&#x27;s Jali&amp;quot;. It was the most highest altitude of Mukteshwar and had some edgy rocks. Perfect place to push
someone into death. But the view was amazing. When I first went at that place, It was horrible experience. It was evening and
so many normie people were talking. The only reason I chose to be on Mukteshwar is because I wanted peace. But those people were
annoying. So I came back early and made a plan. Next morning at 5AM in dark, I forced my friend to go to that place, He was
terrified (dark + forest) but I was excited. He even tried to abandon me but I started going alone, through jungle at dark.
I just wanted to own that place. But then he followed and we went to that same place again, but this time. It was dawn and dayum
whole Mukteshwar lights were like stars. I had stars on top and bottom both. We sat on the most edgy rock and enjoyed the peace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;mukteshwar&#x2F;colleges_in_mukteshwar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cottages&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;waterfall-experience&quot;&gt;Waterfall experience&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mukteshwar also have a famous waterfall. Which was very far away from our cottage. But we had car, so we decided to visit.
We did 800M treking to visit that place and then I ended up again with crowd. The issue is not people. The issue is &amp;quot;They are
annoying&amp;quot;. Every person just wanted a perfect click. I don&#x27;t understand how a person can use phone at such a beautiful place.
I hate these &amp;quot;in cells&amp;quot; people. I can&#x27;t ignore them and I ended up just sitting in the corner and being &lt;em&gt;fly on the wall&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
While my phone was switched off in my bag. I am not against clicking photos, I clicked few too. But I don&#x27;t like trying to
click a perfect picture of me in front of every nice thing I see. I just click a single pic of something, I find cool.
I never try hard to take the best picture. Because I have internet (I can search the exact place pic in 4k).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;mukteshwar&#x2F;place_near_waterfall_in_mukteshwar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waterfall&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunset&quot;&gt;Sunset&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I realized after this trip is, people really don&#x27;t enjoy the place they visit. They just want to increase the number
of places they visit. My way of traveling was very different. I never pressurized myself to see everything. I just enjoyed,
what I had. For example - I knew about a church in Mukteshwar. So I went there, it was close but dayum the sunset behind that church
was so beautiful. I just spend whole evening on that one spot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;mukteshwar&#x2F;sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sunset&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-love-for-darkness&quot;&gt;My love for Darkness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike others I enjoyed Mukteshwar more at Night, My friend called me crazy for that. Because I wanted to go to Jungle in Night.
But he forced me to stayed near the road. But I have to say, that place had peace, which we city people can&#x27;t imagine.
Looking at the dark jungle in complete dark. Beathing fresh air and absolute silence was amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dog&quot;&gt;A Dog&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an animal person, I don&#x27;t like dogs or cats. But in Mukteshwar, every dog was very silent. This is the nature of animals
in hill areas.
I was sitting in the most edgy rock of one of the most highest mountain of Mukteshwar and suddenly a silent dog came next to me.
Obviously I can&#x27;t explain the moment I had with that thing. But it was cool the way he tried to be friend. No pick up line like &amp;quot;woof&amp;quot;.
I was lucky he came silently, because I was on the edge.
I really loved the way he offered a friendship. He walked with us back to jungle whole way followed us, until we reached a temple.
That dog my friend is r&#x2F;animalbeingbros.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;mukteshwar&#x2F;sad-dog-in-mukteshwar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dog&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-thoughts-while-returning&quot;&gt;My thoughts while returning&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really believed, I am 22 and I don&#x27;t need this amount of peace. I want rush, thrill and adventure. It&#x27;s sad but now I realized,
I was not completely disconnected from society and people. Technology connected me in a wrong way. But I need it.
I got urge to use computers again and play games again. I wanted to use my computer all night and listen to loud music. The
peace of Mukteshwar is cool, But I felt like, I will enjoy that peace more after some big battles in life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Time to move on FreeBSD</title>
		<published>2021-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://blog.bugswriter.com/time-to-move-on-freebsd/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all &lt;strong&gt;FreeBSD or any BSD is not Linux or its distro&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freebsd.org&quot;&gt;freebsd.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FreeBSD is an operating system&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms.
A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking,
security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web
sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;freebsd-devil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FreeBSD devil logo&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-freebsd-over-gnu-linux&quot;&gt;Why FreeBSD over GNU&#x2F;Linux?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FreeBSD is an operating system&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is the first selling point for me. Linux is just a kernel and all the
other components like GNU Utils and GUI interfaces in the end of the day provides a working operating system (&lt;em&gt;aka Distro&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;),
But it feels hacky. On the other hand, FreeBSD development is not just a component but the entire OS. Which
means things work very well with each other. That&#x27;s what I understand from all the reading and researching I
did in past few weeks on FreeBSD.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD mailing list is limited to some professional, which is far better than GNU&#x2F;Linux situation.
Now if you don&#x27;t know anything about Linux development, well even I don&#x27;t. But always I get this sense &amp;quot;it&#x27;s not good&amp;quot;.
Anyone can join the team and I feel a lot of mess in the development process.
Now since I am just a user and not a full time kernel developer, I don&#x27;t really want to comment much on this.
But here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;corollari&#x2F;linusrants&quot;&gt;link of a github repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which shows how messed things get sometimes.
Let me quote Linus Torvarlds one line from the mailing list -&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the F*CK, guys? This piece-of-shit commit is marked for stable, but you clearly never even test-compiled it, did you?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--- Linus Torvalds&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe FreeBSD development process is much better because it is done by CS field experts, which just make things much
more reliable.
We all know Linux kernel is getting bloat and more they try to fix this more bad things get. I don&#x27;t remember the year, but
Linus Torvalds himself said &amp;quot;Things are getting out of hand&amp;quot;. Don&#x27;t forget Linux is a project which was started by just a guy
who wanted his own UNIX.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparision to linux performance wise FreeBSD is better, faster, stable, secure and reliable. Isn&#x27;t that enough for leaving GNU&#x2F;Linux
and moving to FreeBSD?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD have much cleaner file organization in comparison to Linux.
If you run &lt;code&gt;ls &#x2F;bin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in FreeBSD you only find programs which is vital for your OS and on &lt;code&gt;ls &#x2F;sbin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; you will find rest of &amp;quot;must to have programs&amp;quot; for your OS.
User programs are always separated from base operating system. Same thing goes with config files too. I love this cleanliness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;freebsd-watch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FreeBSD devil logo&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-not-openbsd-or-netbsd&quot;&gt;Why not OpenBSD or NetBSD?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenBSD is know for security, but for the sake of security it is slower than FreeBSD. Also it&#x27;s not very user-friendly. It&#x27;s good for servers, but
I think FreeBSD is much more focused to being good desktop alternative. Which makes it my first choice.
&lt;em&gt;Also I like the FreeBSD logo more than OpenBSD logo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Now Some people can argue on this and will make some valid point. But I will give FreeBSD a shot first.
May be in future I try OpenBSD on my server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-i-am-expecting&quot;&gt;Issues I am expecting&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very common issue on any BSD is application support.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will I get all the softwares I need?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will I get proper updates?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even If I get updates will I get dependencies (its updates)?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware support?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I will, Because I know how to live with basic command line tools.
My requirements are very limited, I hardly use any GUI program. I read some articles where
soydevs were ranting about why they hated FreeBSD because they can&#x27;t run atom editor.
I think this is not a issue of FreeBSD, the community is excellent and I believe I should
choose FreeBSD because it&#x27;s good, instead of hating it for not having enough users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So today at mid night, I am writing this blog and I am very excited about it. Because this is my first blog on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugswriter.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I always wanted this. My own place on &amp;quot;The Internet&amp;quot;, where I can write whatever I want. I don&#x27;t like getting censored.
This is the main reason why I chose to write here, instead of structuring my rant into 280 character on twitter.
Internet is an amazing place, It changed my life. I don&#x27;t want to go deep on Internet situation.
Since &lt;strong&gt;this is my first blog, this is going to be completely topicless&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-the-deal-here&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s the deal here?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is just a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugswriter.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I have intentions to manage this website&#x2F;blog my whole life. This way I can document my life and thoughts,
and people can know me even after I die.
I want to make it public, since I have some issues interacting with people and making friends. People can know me without even contacting me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have no interest in my life, well here I will also write about tech and other stuff I learn, so those articles can be useful for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe my blogs will be highly informal. If I end up in some bad day&#x2F;mood. I might write some really nasty stuff. Lets hope this never happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to improve my English writing skills. Seems like a great way to do it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate writing on garbage social media platforms (&lt;em&gt;example - facebook, twitter, quora&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). Here I will feel more free and my words don&#x27;t get mixed with noise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-words-regarding-my-poor-writing&quot;&gt;Some words regarding my poor writing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make this clear, I am not good with English. So don&#x27;t expect good literature from me. I write in exact same manner I speak.
I would love to get corrected so if you find any spelling mistake or grammar mistake please &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugswriter.com&#x2F;contact&#x2F;&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
